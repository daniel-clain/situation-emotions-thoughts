* personal addition
  - i was pissing and thought 'i need to pay for 6 month contract here, what if they catch me with my weed and evict me, and i have to pay the remainder rent
  - i thought to my self 'that womans been waiting a long time, its rude to make people chase things and ignore them, i need to do it asap
  - 'ill set myself a reminder to do it so i dont forget'
  - 'why not do it now'
  - 'i have a bad feeling about it, not now (which is the emotional short circuit, behind is im to stoned, im having fun, ill fuck it up, i havent decided, its not simple, id do a better job later)'
  - 'you could force yourself to do it now'

* review
  - this experience could be represented in the game
    ~ why:
      * you checked it and chose not to do it now, so time will pass and the time pressure applied will make the properties change as time passes
      * there is no positive
      * it is important
      * there is risk
        - if i get caught smoking, i lose a lot of money and its a huge stress
        - the chance is: getting caught
        - the yes scenario: 
          ~ positive: null
          ~ negative: in a short period you have to move out deal with lots of stress and lose lots of money
        - the no scenario: 
          ~ positive: null
          ~ negative: null
