note: this list should turn into a test suite


* things are around you
  - circle with you in the center represents a 3d dimension flatten
  - color symbolises how good/bad
    ~ red bad
    ~ green good
  - size represents scale
  - transparency symbolises how true the information is
    ~ the more the thing is unknown, the more its color and size are random
