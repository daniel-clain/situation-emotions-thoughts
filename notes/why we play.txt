ideas on play
=============

* we play because we lost, and we know we can do better

* people like to show their skill and ability
* people like to compete
* because we are progressing and it feels good
* we want to know whats next and we are inching closer
* the higher the challenge you overcome, the greater the rush feels
* the more pride you feel for acomplishments in what you value
* people wanna test how smart they are ( there are lots of different kinds of intelligence)
* people wanna test how creative they are

why do you pay attention to a good game and respect it and be patient and learn and try on repeat to get better
  - people need to know this is a thing that they can work with that gives them something they want
  - it gives them reliable reward relative to the work they put in

what makes a game fun
=======================
* doesnt need competition
  - basketball without the competition is still fun
* there has to be an appropriate challenge
  - not too easy not to hard
  - if the basketball hoop was too big, itd be less fun, if it were too high itd be less fun
* hard fun and soft fun
  - hard fun is the focus challenge
  - easy fun is the exploration playing
